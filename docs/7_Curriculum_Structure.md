## 1. Curriculum Architecture Overview

The curriculum is designed as a **5-dimensional matrix** that allows for flexible content generation and personalized learning paths:

```
Language Pair (2) × CEFR Level (1) × Language Content Category (3) × Interaction Type (3) × Topic Context (9+) = MVP Learning Content
```

**MVP Matrix: 2 × 1 × 3 × 3 × 9 = 162 core content combinations**

**Future Expansion:**
```
Language Pair (10+) × CEFR Level (6) × Language Content Category (5) × Interaction Type (8+) × Topic Context (9+) = Full Learning Content
```
